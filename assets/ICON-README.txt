Icon Files Needed
==================

To customize your application icon, place the following files in this folder:

1. icon.png (Required)
   - Size: 256x256 pixels or larger
   - Format: PNG with transparency
   - Used for: Linux and as source for other formats

2. icon.ico (Required for Windows)
   - Multi-resolution ICO file
   - Recommended sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256
   - Used for: Windows executable, taskbar, shortcuts

How to create an ICO file:
- Use an online converter like: https://convertio.co/png-ico/
- Or use a tool like GIMP, Photoshop, or ImageMagick

Temporary Solution:
- The app will use Electron's default icon until you add your custom icons
- The app will still work perfectly without custom icons

Icon Design Tips:
- Use simple, recognizable shapes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility
- Test at small sizes (16x16) for clarity
- Use transparency for rounded corners
